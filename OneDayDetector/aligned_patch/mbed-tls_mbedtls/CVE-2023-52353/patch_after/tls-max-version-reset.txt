   * Restore the maximum TLS version to be negotiated to the configured one
     when an SSL context is reset with the mbedtls_ssl_session_reset() API.
     An attacker was able to prevent an Mbed TLS server from establishing any
     TLS 1.3 connection potentially resulting in a Denial of Service or forced
     version downgrade from TLS 1.3 to TLS 1.2. Fixes #8654 reported by hey3e.
