	 * relative to Horner's method on sequential machines.
	 *
	 * We add the small terms from lowest degree up for efficiency on
	 * non-sequential machines (the lowest degree terms tend to be ready
	 * earlier).  Apart from this, we don't care about order of
	 * operations, and don't need to to care since we have precision to
	 * spare.  However, the chosen splitting is good for accuracy too,
	 * and would give results as accurate as Horner's method if the
	 * small terms were added from highest degree down.
