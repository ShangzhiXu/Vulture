                                        Unit: ADC clock cycles
                                        Conversion time is the addition of sampling time and processing time (12.5 ADC clock cycles at ADC resolution 12 bits, 10.5 cycles at 10 bits, 8.5 cycles at 8 bits, 6.5 cycles at 6 bits).
                                        This parameter can be a value of @ref ADC_sampling_times
                                        Caution: this setting impacts the entire regular group. Therefore, call of HAL_ADC_ConfigChannel() to configure a channel can impact the configuration of other channels previously set.
                                        Caution: Obsolete parameter. Use parameter "SamplingTimeCommon" in ADC initialization structure.
                                                 If parameter "SamplingTimeCommon" is set to a valid sampling time, parameter "SamplingTime" is discarded.
                                        Note: In case of usage of internal measurement channels (VrefInt/Vbat/TempSensor),
                                              sampling time constraints must be respected (sampling time can be adjusted in function of ADC clock frequency and sampling time setting)
                                              Refer to device datasheet for timings values, parameters TS_vrefint, TS_vbat, TS_temp (values rough order: 5us to 17us). */
