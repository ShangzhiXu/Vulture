                                        Unit: ADC clock cycles
                                        Conversion time is the addition of sampling time and processing time (12 ADC clock cycles at ADC resolution 12 bits, 11 cycles at 10 bits, 9 cycles at 8 bits, 7 cycles at 6 bits).
                                        This parameter can be a value of @ref ADC_sampling_times
                                        Caution: This parameter updates the parameter property of the channel, that can be used into regular and/or injected groups.
                                                 If this same channel has been previously configured in the other group (regular/injected), it will be updated to last setting.
                                        Note: In case of usage of internal measurement channels (VrefInt/Vbat/TempSensor),
                                              sampling time constraints must be respected (sampling time can be adjusted in function of ADC clock frequency and sampling time setting)
                                              Refer to device datasheet for timings values, parameters TS_vrefint, TS_temp (values rough order: 4us min). */
