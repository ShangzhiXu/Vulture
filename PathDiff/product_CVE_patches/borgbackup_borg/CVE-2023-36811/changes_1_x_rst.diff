+
+Pre-1.2.5 archives spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2023-36811)
+----------------------------------------------------------
+
+A flaw in the cryptographic authentication scheme in Borg allowed an attacker to
+fake archives and potentially indirectly cause backup data loss in the repository.
+
+The attack requires an attacker to be able to
+
+1. insert files (with no additional headers) into backups
+2. gain write access to the repository
+
+This vulnerability does not disclose plaintext to the attacker, nor does it
+affect the authenticity of existing archives.
+
+Creating plausible fake archives may be feasible for empty or small archives,
+but is unlikely for large archives.
+
+The fix enforces checking the TAM authentication tag of archives at critical
+places. Borg now considers archives without TAM as garbage or an attack.
+
+We are not aware of others having discovered, disclosed or exploited this vulnerability.
+
+Below, if we speak of borg 1.2.5, we mean a borg version >= 1.2.5 **or** a
+borg version that has the relevant security patches for this vulnerability applied
+(could be also an older version in that case).
+
+Steps you must take to upgrade a repository:
+
+1. Upgrade all clients using this repository to borg 1.2.5.
+   Note: it is not required to upgrade a server, except if the server-side borg
+   is also used as a client (and not just for "borg serve").
+
+   Do **not** run ``borg check`` with borg 1.2.5 before completing the upgrade steps.
+
+2. Run ``borg info --debug <repository> 2>&1 | grep TAM | grep -i manifest``.
+
+   a) If you get "TAM-verified manifest", continue with 3.
+   b) If you get "Manifest TAM not found and not required", run
+      ``borg upgrade --tam --force <repository>`` *on every client*.
+
+3. Run ``borg list --format='{name} {time} tam:{tam}{NL}' <repository>``.
+   "tam:verified" means that the archive has a valid TAM authentication.
+   "tam:none" is expected as output for archives created by borg <1.0.9.
+   "tam:none" could also come from archives created by an attacker.
+   You should verify that "tam:none" archives are authentic and not malicious
+   (== have good content, have correct timestamp, can be extracted successfully).
+   In case you find crappy/malicious archives, you must delete them before proceeding.
+   In low-risk, trusted environments, you may decide on your own risk to skip step 3
+   and just trust in everything being OK.
+
+4. If there are no tam:non archives left at this point, you can skip this step.
+   Run ``borg upgrade --archives-tam <repository>``.
+   This will make sure all archives are TAM authenticated (an archive TAM will be added
+   for all archives still missing one).
+   ``borg check`` would consider TAM-less archives as garbage or a potential attack.
+   Optionally run the same command as in step 3 to see that all archives now are "tam:verified".
