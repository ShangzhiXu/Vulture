+     * Analysis: The longest fixed codes are a length code of 8 bits plus 5
+     * extra bits, for lengths 131 to 257. The longest fixed distance codes are
+     * 5 bits plus 13 extra bits, for distances 16385 to 32768. The longest
+     * possible fixed-codes length/distance pair is then 31 bits total.
+     *
+     * sym_buf starts one-fourth of the way into pending_buf. So there are
+     * three bytes in sym_buf for every four bytes in pending_buf. Each symbol
+     * in sym_buf is three bytes -- two for the distance and one for the
+     * literal/length. As each symbol is consumed, the pointer to the next
+     * sym_buf value to read moves forward three bytes. From that symbol, up to
+     * 31 bits are written to pending_buf. The closest the written pending_buf
+     * bits gets to the next sym_buf symbol to read is just before the last
+     * code is written. At that time, 31*(n-2) bits have been written, just
+     * after 24*(n-2) bits have been consumed from sym_buf. sym_buf starts at
+     * 8*n bits into pending_buf. (Note that the symbol buffer fills when n-1
+     * symbols are written.) The closest the writing gets to what is unread is
+     * then n+14 bits. Here n is lit_bufsize, which is 16384 by default, and
+     * can range from 128 to 32768.
+     *
+     * Therefore, at a minimum, there are 142 bits of space between what is
+     * written and what is read in the overlain buffers, so the symbols cannot
+     * be overwritten by the compressed data. That space is actually 139 bits,
+     * due to the three-bit fixed-code block header.
+     *
+     * That covers the case where either Z_FIXED is specified, forcing fixed
+     * codes, or when the use of fixed codes is chosen, because that choice
+     * results in a smaller compressed block than dynamic codes. That latter
+     * condition then assures that the above analysis also covers all dynamic
+     * blocks. A dynamic-code block will only be chosen to be emitted if it has
+     * fewer bits than a fixed-code block would for the same set of symbols.
+     * Therefore its average symbol length is assured to be less than 31. So
+     * the compressed data for a dynamic block also cannot overwrite the
+     * symbols from which it is being constructed.
